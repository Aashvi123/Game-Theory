    "We are taking other example In this game, if player B chooses left , then player A’s pay-offs are either 4 or 0. While, when player B chooses right, player A’s pay-offs are 0 or 2. Hence, if B chooses left A should choose Top and if B chooses Right then A should choose Bottom. This, optimal choice of A is dependent on what choice B makes. A pair of strategies is said to be Nash equilibrium (NE), if optimal choice of Player A given Player B’s choice coincides with optimal choice of Player B given Player A’s choice. In simple terms, initially neither player knows what the other player will do when deciding or making a choice. Hence NE is a pair of choices/strategies/expectations where neither player wants to change their behaviour even after the strategy/choice of the other player is revealed. In this game, strategy (Top, Left) is a Nash equilibrium because if A chooses Top, then the best thing for B is to choose Left because his pay-off for choosing left is 2 as opposed to 0 if he chooses bottom. Similarly if B chooses left then best choice for A is to choose Top, because he will get a higher pay-off of 4 if he chooses Top versus he will get 0 if he chooses Bottom. **So, can there be multiple Nash equilibrium? The answer is Yes. In this game we just discussed, in fact we have 2 Nash equilibria- the strategy (Bottom, Right) is also a NE because if A chooses Bottom, B should choose Right and vice versa"
